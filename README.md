Stopwatch Project: A stopwatch is a timekeeping device used to measure the duration of an event. The stopwatch project is a digital implementation of a stopwatch that allows users to accurately measure elapsed time with precision. It is a useful tool for tracking time intervals, timing sporting events, or simply keeping track of time.
Key Features:

Start, Stop, and Reset: The stopwatch allows the user to start the timer, pause it, and reset it to zero.
Lap Time: It provides the option to record lap times, allowing users to track individual segments of time during a longer event.
Accurate Timing: The stopwatch offers precise timing by capturing time in milliseconds, ensuring high accuracy.
User-Friendly Interface: The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it simple for anyone to operate the stopwatch.
Clear Display: The elapsed time is displayed prominently on the screen, making it easy to read and track.
Technologies Used:
The stopwatch project can be implemented using various technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JavaScript is particularly useful for capturing time intervals and updating the display in real-time. CSS can be used to enhance the visual design, while HTML provides the structure for the stopwatch interface.
